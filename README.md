## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Bootstrap

### What I learned
I learned how to embedd downloaded fonts into the css code

```css
 @font-face {
    font-family: "Figtree";
    src: url('assets\fonts\Figtree-Italic-VariableFont_wght.ttf') format("Woff2"),
         url('assets\fonts\Figtree-VariableFont_wght.ttf') format("Woff2");
 }
```

### Continued development

I would like to further learn how to compact and reduce my css code to make it easier to read and implement 

### Useful resources

- (https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/components/card/)- At some point i got stuck on how to implement the card component in bootstrap and this helped
